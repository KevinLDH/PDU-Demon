Figures:
Reactor Feed Rate and Input Rate (0.25min, 1min, 5min)
Metering Bin
Storage Bins
*Carbohydrate Content (For different biomass types)
Pellet Equipment Flow Rate (0.25min, 5min)

To generate figures:
1) if one biomass type:
	1. Change input file direction
	2. Change biomassIndex = 1 on line 16
	3. Comment lines from 73 to 86
	4. Comment lines from 278 to 280
	5. Comment lines from 289 to 310
2) if different biomass types:
	1. Change input file direction
	2. Change biomassIndex = n (n is the number of biomass) on line 16
	3. Uncomment lines from 73 to 86
	4. Uncomment lines from 278 to 280
	5. Uncomment lines from 289 to 310
