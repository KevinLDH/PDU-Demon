# PDU-Demon
These codes are used to run experiments through PDU.
------
This repository includes two types of python codes.
1) "PDU Demon DSS.py" is for solving MIP model. (contains 4 functions: DataInput; SequenceInitial; MILPModel; DataOutput.)
2) "Calculate Results PDU Demon.py" is for creating different graphs (Infeed and reactor feeding rate; metering bin inventory; storage bins inventory; pelleting flow; carbohydrate level).
------
This repository includes a file of input data, along with a file for explanation.
1) "PDU Demon Data Basic.txt" is the input data file.
2) "Parameter Explain.txt" is the explanation file.
------
Notes: when run for random sequences, please comment lines 114 to 118.
I also explain how to change parameters in "Parameter Explain.txt".
